We are a registered student organization at the University of Illinois focused on creating lasting connections and bonds for individuals with a common interest in anthropomorphic animals in media. This includes furries, artists, mascot enthusiasts, therians, and more. Drawings, paintings, animations, costumes (both cosplay and fursuits), music, and beyond -- if it includes anthropomorphic animals, it's something we're interested in appreciating, discussing, and creating.

Our activities are primarily social. They can vary in content, including art sessions, board game nights, art and crafting tutorials, discussions of current topics in the wider community, and other fun activities. Occasionally, we organize outings to various features of local interest: primarily, furry conventions such as Midwest Furfest or FurSquared, but also corn mazes, cookouts, camping trips, and so on. *For active, undergraduate and graduate student members of the club, there are frequently opportunities for payment assistance or discounts on such travel -- look out for more information on this as events are announced.* Meetings occur weekly during the fall and spring semesters -- see [our events page](/events) for more details. [Join our group chat](/chat) or email us at [illinifurs@gmail.com](mailto:illinifurs@gmail.com) for access to our newsletter and more details about our club.

## We hope to see you soon!
