We are a registered student organization at the University of Illinois focused on creating lasting connections and bonds for individuals with a common interest in anthropomorphic animals in media. This includes furries, artists, mascot enthusiasts, therians, and more. Drawings, paintings, animations, costumes (both cosplay and fursuits), music, and beyond -- if it includes anthropomorphic animals, it's something we're interested in appreciating, discussing, and creating.

Our activities are primarily social. They can vary in content, including art sessions, board game nights, art and crafting tutorials, discussions of current topics in the wider community, and other fun activities. Occasionally, we organize outings to various features of local interest: primarily, furry conventions such as Midwest Furfest or FurSquared, but also corn mazes, cookouts, camping trips, and so on. *For active, undergraduate and graduate student members of the club, there are frequently opportunities for payment assistance or discounts on such travel -- look out for more information on this as events are announced.* Meetings occur weekly during the fall and spring semesters -- see [our events page](/events) for more details. [Join our group chat](/chat) or email us at [illinifurs@gmail.com](mailto:illinifurs@gmail.com) for access to our newsletter and more details about our club.

# What is a furry?

The term "furry" describes a community of diverse interests who come together to discuss and appreciate media featuring anthropomorphic animals. You might think of the characters in movies like *Zootopia*, with its metropolis of animals walking and talking with each other. Alternatively, you might think of video game icons like Sonic the Hedgehog, or even the rabbits whose adventures are chronicled in the book *Watership Down*. This community includes fans, artists, writers, cosplayers, gamers, role players, and more. There is no exact definition as to what makes a furry, as so many people participate in so many different ways, or what makes media furry instead of popular culture. In general, though, we would define a furry as someone who both enjoys the idea of anthropomorphic animals and describes themselves as a furry.

For more information about furries, including a robust body of scientific research, we recommend [Furscience](https://furscience.com/whats-a-furry/), the public face of the International Anthropomorphic Research Project (IARP). The IARP is a multidisciplinary team of scientists studying the furry fandom via psychology, anthropology, and sociology.

Importantly, the IlliniFurs are open to all, and we count among our members many individuals who do not describe themselves as furries. Whether or not you are a furry, we strive to make our organization a welcoming and enriching space!

# We hope to see you soon!
