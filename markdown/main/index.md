Furries are a subculture of people who are interested in discussing and appreciating media featuring anthropomorphic animals, from Rocket Raccoon in *Guardians of the Galaxy*, to characters in video games like Sonic The Hedgehog, or the cast of Disney film *Zootopia*. Of course, nowhere will you find a hard and concrete definition of what a furry is, or what constitutes furry media versus just popular culture. The furry fandom as a whole is an ever-changing, ever-whirling maelstrom where the edges are never constant but the center always is. As resolutely as anything can be stated, those who identify as furries enjoy the idea of anthropomorphic animals.

This group is intended as a community of such individuals, designated to further their interests and give them an opportunity to explore these interests with other like-minded people.

Activities are primarily social, though this includes art sessions, discussion of matters of fandom intrigue (such as the 2020 documentary *The Fandom*, by Ash Kreis and Eric Risher), social board game nights, and other such activities. Meetings are currently every week. Email us at illinifurs@gmail.com for access to our newsletter and more details.
